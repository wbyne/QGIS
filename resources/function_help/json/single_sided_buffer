  "description": "Returns a geometry formed by buffering out just one side of a linestring geometry. Distances are in the Spatial Reference System of this geometry.",
  "arguments": [ {"arg":"geometry","description":"a (multi)linestring geometry"},
                 {"arg":"distance","description":"buffer distance. Positive values will be buffered to the left of lines, negative values to the right"},
                 {"arg":"segments","optional":true,"default":"8","description":"number of segments to use to represent a quarter circle when a round join style is used. A larger number results in a smoother buffer with more nodes."},
                 {"arg":"join","optional":true,"default":"1","description":"join style for corners, where 1 = round, 2 = mitre and 3 = bevel"},
                 {"arg":"mitre_limit","optional":true,"default":"2.0","description":"limit on the mitre ratio used for very sharp corners (when using mitre joins only)"}],
