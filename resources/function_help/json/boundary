  "name": "boundary",
  "type": "function",
  "description":"Returns the closure of the combinatorial boundary of the geometry (ie the topological boundary of the geometry). For instance, a polygon geometry will have a boundary consisting of the linestrings for each ring in the polygon. Some geometry types do not have a defined boundary, eg points or geometry collections, and will return null.",
