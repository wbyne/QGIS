  "type": "function",
  "description":"Simplifies a geometry by removing nodes using an area based threshold (ie, the Visvalingam-Whyatt algorithm). The algorithm removes vertices which create small areas in geometries, eg narrow spikes or nearly straight segments.",
  "arguments": [ {"arg":"geometry","description":"a geometry"},
                 {"arg":"tolerance","description":"a measure of the maximum area created by a node for the node to be removed"} ],
  "examples": [ { "expression":"geom_to_wkt(simplify_vw(geometry:=geom_from_wkt('LineString(0 0, 5 0, 5.01 10, 5.02 0, 10 0)'),tolerance:=5))", "returns":"'LineString(0 0, 10 0)'"}]
