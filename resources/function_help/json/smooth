                 {"arg":"offset", "optional":true,"description":"value between 0 and 0.5 which controls how tightly the smoothed geometry follow the original geometry. Smaller values result in a tighter smoothing, larger values result in looser smoothing."},
                 {"arg":"min_length", "optional":true,"description":"minimum length of segments to apply smoothing to. This parameter can be used to avoid placing excessive additional nodes in shorter segments of the geometry."},
                 {"arg":"max_angle", "optional":true,"description":"maximum angle at node for smoothing to be applied (0-180). By lowering the maximum angle intentionally sharp corners in the geometry can be preserved. For instance, a value of 80 degrees will retain right angles in the geometry."} ],
