Description: Geographic Information System (GIS)
 A Geographic Information System (GIS) manages, analyzes, and displays
 databases of geographic information. QGIS supports shape file viewing and
 editing, spatial data storage with PostgreSQL/PostGIS, projection on-the-fly,
 map composition, and a number of other features via a plugin interface. QGIS
 also supports display of various georeferenced raster and Digital Elevation
 Model (DEM) formats including GeoTIFF, Arc/Info ASCII Grid, and USGS ASCII
 DEM.
